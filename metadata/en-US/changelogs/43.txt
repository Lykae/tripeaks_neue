- Fixed an issue with undo: Wrong chain length & score were being restored.
- Fixed an issue with statistics: Current chain weren't included in the score if a new game started without clearing the current game.
- The card counter now also shows the current chain (circle indicators).
- "Dependencies" card now also includes indirect dependencies.
- Added a new card decoration.
